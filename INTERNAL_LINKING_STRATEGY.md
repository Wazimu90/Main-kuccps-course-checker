## INTERNAL LINKING RULES IMPLEMENTED

### ✅ Best Practices Followed:

1. **Never repeat the same anchor text too many times on one page**
   - Mixed exact anchors with natural sentence anchors
   - Varied anchor text for same destination

2. **Natural sentence anchors over generic "click here"**
   - Good: "Before applying, check KUCCPS courses you qualify for to avoid wrong choices"
   - Bad: "Click here to check courses"

3. **Downward linking hierarchy:**
   - Degree → Diploma → Certificate → Artisan → Learn Skills
   - Tools pages receive the most links

4. **Footer links ≠ contextual links**
   - Contextual links within content matter more
   - Footer used for structural navigation only

5. **Commercial links treated carefully**
   - Buy Data NOT pushed aggressively
   - Positioned as utility, not sales pitch

---

## HEADER HIERARCHY OPTIMIZATION (H1-H6)

### Semantic Structure Enforced:

**Each Page:**
- **Single H1**: Main page title (primary keyword)
- **H2**: Major sections
- **H3**: Subsections
- **H4-H6**: Nested content as needed

**Example Structure (Degree Page):**
```html
<h1>KUCCPS Degree Courses - Check Eligibility with Your KCSE Grades</h1>

<section>
  <h2>How to Check Which Degree Courses You Qualify For</h2>
  <h3>Step 1: Enter Your KCSE Subject Grades</h3>
  <h3>Step 2: Enter Cluster Weights</h3>
</section>

<section>
  <h2>Popular Degree Programs Available via KUCCPS</h2>
  <h3>Engineering Courses</h3>
  <h3>Medical Courses</h3>
</section>
```

### SEO Optimization in Headers:
- Keywords naturally integrated
- Descriptive, not stuffed
- Proper nesting (no H3 under H3 without an H2)
