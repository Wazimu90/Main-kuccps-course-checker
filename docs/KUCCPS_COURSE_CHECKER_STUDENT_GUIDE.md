# KUCCPS Course Checker — Complete Student Guide (2026)

## 1. What This Website Does
This website helps KCSE students instantly find out which university and college courses they qualify for. Instead of manually checking thousands of courses in the "blue book," you simply enter your grades, and our system calculates your cluster points (for degrees) or grade matches (for diplomas/certificates/kmtc/artisan) to show you a personalized list of eligible courses from all institutions in Kenya.

## 2. Who It Helps
*   **Form Four Graduates**: Who want to know their course options before the official KUCCPS portal opens or closes.
*   **Parents**: Who want to help their children make informed career choices without getting confused by complex calculations.
*   **Teachers & Career Masters**: Who need a quick tool to guide students on realistic course choices.

## 3. Quick Start (60 Seconds)
1.  **Touch "Check courses"** on the home screen or select a category (e.g., Degree, Diploma).
2.  **Enter your KCSE Grades**: Start with your Mean Grade, then enter subject grades if asked.
3.  **Wait for Analysis**: The system will verify your qualifications against KUCCPS requirements for thousands of courses.
4.  **View Preview**: You will see how many courses you qualify for.
5.  **Unlock Results**: Pay the small service fee (usually KES 200) via M-Pesa to see the full list.
6.  **Download PDF**: Save your personalized list to your phone for offline use or printing.

## 6. Cluster Calculator
This is a powerful tool separate from the "Degree Checker". Use this if you just want to know your points without generating a full list of courses.

*   **What are Cluster Points?**: KUCCPS uses a formula that combines your total KCSE performance with your performance in 4 key subjects relevant to a specific course. This is your "Cluster Weight".
*   **What this tool does**: It calculates your weight for **all 20 categories** (e.g., Law, Engineering, Medicine, Business) at once.
*   **How to use**:
    1.  Go to **Cluster Calculator**.
    2.  Select your Mean Grade.
    3.  Enter your grades for all subjects.
    4.  Click **Calculate**.
*   **Interpreting Results**:
    *   **Cluster Weight**: Your score out of 48. Higher is better.
    *   **Tier**: We label scores as "Strong Fit" (Tier A), "Competitive" (Tier B), or "Low" (Tier C) to help you guess your chances.
    *   **Copy/Download**: You can copy these results or download them as a text file to keep.

## 14. Troubleshooting Common Issues

### **PDF Not Downloading**
If your PDF fails to download after payment:

1.  **Check Your Browser Settings**:
    *   On mobile (especially Chrome), look for a download prompt at the bottom of your screen or in the notification bar.
    *   Tap "Download" or "Yes" when prompted.
    *   Some browsers block automatic downloads — check your "Downloads" folder anyway.

2.  **Pop-up Blockers**:
    *   Disable pop-up blockers temporarily for our site.
    *   Try a different browser (Chrome, Firefox, Edge, or Samsung Internet).

3.  **Retry from Results Page**:
    *   If you're still on the results page, click the **"Download PDF"** button again.
    *   Wait until you see a confirmation or feel the download start.

4.  **Clear Browser Cache**:
    *   Sometimes old data can interfere. Clear your browser cache and cookies, then try again.

### **Result ID Missing or Lost**
If you cannot find your Result ID:

1.  **Check Your Email**:
    *   After successful payment, we send a confirmation email with your Result ID.
    *   Search your inbox (and spam/junk folder) for "KUCCPS Course Checker" or "Result ID".

2.  **Check M-Pesa Message**:
    *   Your M-Pesa confirmation message contains the transaction code.
    *   Contact support with this code — we can trace your Result ID from the payment.

3.  **Contact Your Agent**:
    *   If you used an agent's referral code, message them with your phone number and payment details.
    *   They can look up your results and re-send your PDF.

4.  **Contact Support**:
    *   WhatsApp: +254790295408 or +254713111921
    *   Email: kuccpscoursechecker1@gmail.com
    *   Provide: Your name, phone number used for payment, and M-Pesa transaction code.

### **Page Not Loading or Errors**
*   **Check Internet Connection**: Ensure you have stable internet.
*   **Refresh the Page**: Sometimes a simple refresh fixes temporary glitches.
*   **Try Incognito/Private Mode**: This rules out extension or cache issues.
*   **Use a Different Device**: If issues persist, try on another phone or computer.

### **Grades Not Saving or Form Resetting**
*   Ensure you don't refresh the page midway through entering grades.
*   Use the same browser throughout the entire process (from grade entry to payment).
*   Avoid switching tabs during payment — return to the original tab after M-Pesa confirmation.

## 15. Payment Issues & Recovery

### **I Paid But Didn't Get Results**
This is the most common issue. Here's what to do:

1.  **Wait 1-2 Minutes**: Sometimes there's a slight delay in processing. Do not refresh immediately; wait a moment.

2.  **Check Your M-Pesa Balance**: Confirm the money was actually deducted.

3.  **Re-enter Your Phone Number**: If you're stuck, try reloading the page and entering the same phone number you used for payment. Our system automatically detects completed payments.

        *   Screenshot of M-Pesa confirmation (if possible)
    *   We will manually verify your payment and send you your results.

### **Money Was Deducted Twice / Double Payment**
*   This is rare, but if it happens:
    *   Do NOT keep retrying payments.
    *   Contact support with M-Pesa transaction codes for both payments.
    *   We will verify and process a refund for the extra payment.

### **STK Push Not Received**
If you don't receive the M-Pesa pop-up:
*   Ensure you entered the correct phone number (07... or 01...).
*   Make sure M-Pesa is set up on your phone (especially if you have a new phone or SIM).
*   Try restarting your phone or toggling airplane mode briefly.
*   If repeated failures, try paying from a different Mpesa line.

### **Payment Timeout**
*   If the payment times out, your money is NOT deducted.
*   Wait a few seconds and try again.
*   Ensure you have enough balance and your phone is connected to the network.
