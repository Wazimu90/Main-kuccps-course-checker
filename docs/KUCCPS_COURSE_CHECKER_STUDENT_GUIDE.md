# KUCCPS Course Checker — Complete Student Guide (2026)

## 1. What This Website Does
This website helps KCSE students instantly find out which university and college courses they qualify for. Instead of manually checking thousands of courses in the "blue book," you simply enter your grades, and our system calculates your cluster points (for degrees) or grade matches (for diplomas/certificates/kmtc/artisan) to show you a personalized list of eligible courses from all institutions in Kenya.

## 2. Who It Helps
*   **Form Four Graduates**: Who want to know their course options before the official KUCCPS portal opens or closes.
*   **Parents**: Who want to help their children make informed career choices without getting confused by complex calculations.
*   **Teachers & Career Masters**: Who need a quick tool to guide students on realistic course choices.

## 3. Quick Start (60 Seconds)
1.  **Touch "Check courses"** on the home screen or select a category (e.g., Degree, Diploma).
2.  **Enter your KCSE Grades**: Start with your Mean Grade, then enter subject grades if asked.
3.  **Wait for Analysis**: The system will verify your qualifications against KUCCPS requirements for thousands of courses.
4.  **View Preview**: You will see how many courses you qualify for.
5.  **Unlock Results**: Pay the small service fee (usually KES 200) via M-Pesa to see the full list.

## 6. Cluster Calculator
This is a powerful tool separate from the "Degree Checker". Use this if you just want to know your points without generating a full list of courses.

*   **What are Cluster Points?**: KUCCPS uses a formula that combines your total KCSE performance with your performance in 4 key subjects relevant to a specific course. This is your "Cluster Weight".
*   **What this tool does**: It calculates your weight for **all 20 categories** (e.g., Law, Engineering, Medicine, Business) at once.
*   **How to use**:
    1.  Go to **Cluster Calculator**.
    2.  Select your Mean Grade.
    3.  Enter your grades for all subjects.
    4.  Click **Calculate**.
*   **Interpreting Results**:
    *   **Cluster Weight**: Your score out of 48. Higher is better.
    *   **Tier**: We label scores as "Strong Fit" (Tier A), "Competitive" (Tier B), or "Low" (Tier C) to help you guess your chances.
    *   **Copy/Download**: You can copy these results or download them as a text file to keep.
