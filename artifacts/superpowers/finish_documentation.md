## Objective
Create a comprehensive Markdown document detailing all user-facing features, tools, sections, and pages of the "kuccpscoursechecker.co.ke" website for students.

## Work Accomplished
1.  **Analyzed Codebase**: Reviewed `app/`, `components/`, and key pages (`about`, `contact`, `faq`, `payment`, `results`, `student-tools`, etc.) to understand features.
2.  **Created Documentation**:
    -   File: `docs/KUCCPS_COURSE_CHECKER_STUDENT_GUIDE.md`
    -   Content includes:
        -   Overview & Target Audience
        -   Quick Start Guide
        -   Detailed guides for all 5 Course Checkers (Degree, Diploma, etc.)
        -   Cluster Calculator & Results Page guides
        -   Payment, Refund, and Support details
        -   **Inventory Table** of all 15+ routes/pages
        -   FAQ & Glossary
3.  **Updated Changelog**: Added entry to `CHANGELOG.md`.

## Verification
-   Verified file existence: `docs/KUCCPS_COURSE_CHECKER_STUDENT_GUIDE.md` exists (11KB).
-   Verified content accuracy against current codebase implementation (e.g., specific buttons, contact info, creator profile).

## Next Steps
-   The user can link this guide in the "Help" section of the website if desired.
-   Consider converting this Markdown to a styled HTML page (`/guide`) in a future task.
